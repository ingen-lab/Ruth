ElfEars - 10 January 2018
AGPL by Fred K. Beckhusen

The ElfEars attachment should load and be attachable as two separate prims.

You will need to apply a skin texture like an avatar has, or color it as skin.
There are blank skin textures at the Outworldz image collection.

Then do a ctrl-F and look for skin, or Starlight for an open source
starlight_face texture.

The ElfEars can be resized and moved about like any attachment.
* ElfEars-Original is the originally sized longer pointy ears.
* ElfEars is a scaled down more subtle version.

For Ruth 2.0, you can simply add in the current "Head Receiver" script
(called "r2_head_receiver.lsl" at present) and the normal Ruth 2.0
Skin Applier will also set your ears to the appropriate skin texture.
To achieve this the Description field of BOTH ear parts needs to be
set to "head" without the quotation marks. The prepared versions in
the OpenSim Inventory ARCHIVE (.iar) supplied are already set this way.
