This file is based on the osRoth2_DevKit_RC_1+Weighting_For_Clothing.blend

osRoth2_DevKit_RC_1_Alpha_Cut_V01.blend is exactly as the clothing file
but now with an alpha cut which you can use as an avatar.

It needs to be connected to the Roth HUD (script) which you can find in the GitHub Ruth.

Change the T-pose in an A-pose if you want to use this avatar for the HUD.
