osRoth2_CurrentRelease_DevKit_RC#1.blend - This blender file is intended for content creators. It is an exact duplicate of the source file but textured with the alpha cut faces used for the official RC#1 release. I usually join the parts as a personal preference but I am leaving that up to each content creator's preference.

osRuth2_B3.6.1-A3.5.0_Step3b_DevKit_R2.0.dae - I will be providing a collada file for attachment creators using Avastar v3.1.0+
