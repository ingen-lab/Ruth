# Ruth and Roth 2.0 Mesh Avatar Project

Ruth and Roth 2.0 are low-poly mesh bodies, specifically designed for OpenSimulator. They are built to use standard Second Life(TM) UV maps using scratch-built open source mesh bodies by Shin Ingen with other open source contributions from the OpenSimulator Community.

The original intent of this project was to create a working mesh avatar for the Opensimulator that I can use as a teaching model for content creation using tools such as blender and zbrush. It had been years since I last updated the project with RC#3 being the last improvement. I think I can now work on the release version which I would simply call Ruth 2.0
